# CP-Find-Your-Hat

My implementation of the Codecademy Challenge Project 'Find Your Hat'

Find Your Hat is a (as specified) single player maze game using simple graphics.

The goal of the game is to find your 'hat' (a '^' character) without falling down a 'hole (a 'O' character) or going outside the bounds of the 'board'.

Visited positions i.e. the player's path through the game board  represented by '*'s.
